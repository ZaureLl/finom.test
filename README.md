Frontend Development Test Task

Your task is to create a webpage based on the provided design with the following requirements:

The webpage should be hosted publicly (GitHub pages, codepen.io, your own hosting—whatever allows easy viewing on the web without local builds). The main focus is the result in the browser; source code is optional but would be a nice bonus.

You can use any familiar componentization methodology—BEM, SMACSS, or any other you prefer.

Cross-browser compatibility—Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox on Windows and MacOS, Safari on MacOS. It's acceptable to support the latest 5 versions, with Safari not lower than version 14.

Responsiveness—the design is provided for one resolution, but the layout should be responsive starting from 900px width (feel free to use your imagination!). Optional: make it responsive down to 320px.

JavaScript—using any framework (or native JS), implement the tab switching for settings (clicking on a left column item should entirely change the content on the right), and the dropdown menu for selecting a company (top right corner). The company selection functionality can be omitted, but the menu items should be interactive. Optional: implement a chat window on the bottom right.

Animations and states—add animations and interactive elements as you see fit, showing creativity and making the interactive elements lively.

Semantic markup and accessibility are necessary but without overcomplicating.

Additional Notes:
During the evaluation, focus will mainly be on the accuracy of the layout compared to the design. Therefore, it's better to aim for pixel-perfection and animations rather than an elaborate build system just for this page.
